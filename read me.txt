INSTRUCTIONS:

Extract files to desktop:
include / lib / libtcc.dll / tcc.exe / setup.py
merge your C:\Python34\include into the include folder

put your main.py on desktop
run setup.py (will generate > main.c)

open cmd and type, cd desktop (instead of user folder)
copy this next line in, and you're done!
tcc.exe main.c -o main.pyd -shared -Iinclude -Llib -lpython34

----------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT PART!
The Cython included with this is for Python 3.4.
It should work for any Python 3 version:
If not, download another Cython module in replacement.

Almost every Python module you can want!

Since they're all .whl files, just use winrar to open it.
And drag out the needed files.

You can also put them here: (for the long run =D)
C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages

----------------------------------------------------

P.S. If you're a good programmer, you'd have realized,
you can rename 'main' into whatever you want.
By modifying setup.py and the cmd code. =)


HOPE YOU ALL ARE HAPPY
