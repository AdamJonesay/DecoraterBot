# DecoraterBot & Decorater
### 2 Python Bots 1 Repository

To get them to work:
[DecoraterBotCore](https://github.com/AraHaan/DecoraterBotCore/) and [DecoraterCore](https://github.com/AraHaan/DecoraterCore/)

The 2 things you can install simply to get it to work. (If you do not want to manually download them from the repositories.)

    pip install git+https://github.com/AraHaan/DecoraterBotCore@pip
    pip install git+https://github.com/AraHaan/DecoraterCore@Async

##I do Update the bot pretty much but I happen to rarely push unless I know it is stable somewhat.
##but since this if you do not want to ``pip install`` them download them manually and extract only the folder(s) named ``DecoraterBotCore`` and/or ``DecoraterCore``.
