# DecoraterBot Portable Version
###I do Update the bot pretty much but I happen to rarely push unless I know it is stable somewhat.
###To get this to work you need a Working Bot Token.
###You will Also need your account ID and Your Bot account's id to be able to use most of the commands.
###After you config it to a token you can run the bot with ``DecoraterBot.bat``.
